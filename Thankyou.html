                  <p style="text-align: justify;line-height:1.5;">
                    Firstly, I want to thank you for your participation, your
                    support for the I CARE campaign and the trust you have
                    placed in me as your President.
                  </br></br>I am honoured and humbled to be successor to many exemplary Graduate Students’ Union
                    Presidents and it will be a privilege and am delighted to
                    serve as a President who can contribute to the Union’s
                    strong history of firsts. I’d like to thank the electoral
                    commission for facilitating the Mi-Voice online voting
                    system which contributed to another first, when I became the
                    first Union President in the history of the College to be
                    elected purely through electronic vote. 
                </br></br> I deeply appreciate
                    all who cast their votes and chose me to represent you with
                    the highest amount of votes cast for any other GSU President
                    to date. I believe it is absolutely no accident that we have
                    seen such an increase in engagement and interest during a
                    very difficult time when COVID-19 has created new challenges
                    for us all. As we make our way through this crisis, we need
                    to craft a positive vision for the future. I thank you for
                    giving such a strong mandate to me with your votes and the I
                    CARE philosophy. 
                  </br></br>I have never taken a single day for granted
                    as Vice president of the GSU, and you, the students have
                    taught me in ways that you will never know. I want to thank
                    all the postgraduates students who have shared their
                    stories, ideas and concerns with me over the last four years
                    in the GSU. Through working with you I have learnt the
                    importance of facing challenges with new creative thinking
                    and I have learnt the importance of caring. 
                    </br></br>I truly believe
                    that empathy and effective leadership go hand in hand. The
                    ‘I CARE’ philosophy has been central to my campaign and will
                    guide my presidency. There are five strands to the I CARE
                    vision; Innovation, Community, Awareness, Research and
                    Equality. I took these five principles into rooms and
                    corridors all across Trinity and tested them, and the
                    postgraduate community helped me elaborate on different
                    aspects of it. 
                    </br></br>I have been so glad to learn that I am not on
                    my own in my thinking. I am very grateful to my campaign
                    team, particularly Stephen Odundo who did so much to develop
                    and help me realise the I CARE vision. I have never met
                    anyone as motivated by the philosophy of change and he is
                    indispensable in the work that I do. I want to express huge
                    thanks also to those who worked hard to bring the I CARE
                    message to postgraduate students including through the
                    building of an engaging digital platform. 
                    </br></br>I will continue to
                    work with others and look forward to examining the issues on
                    the table and acting on them as a team together with the
                    other members of the GSU executive. Most importantly, I will
                    continue to work with you. I am determined that the GSU will
                    find new and innovative ways to involve and engage
                    postgraduate students from seminars, and listening clinics
                    to communal virtual GSU lunch tables. We will look at where
                    there are bridges to be built between the different
                    communities and find new ways to facilitate social
                    inclusion. I have seen how fresh interest and culture
                    connections can be used to build bridges with an investment
                    of time and proper listening. 
                  </br></br>The work we do reaches farther
                    than any personal goal, it is more significant than any
                    percentages or turnout figures or valid votes. I will be
                    seeking to make change while making sure our GSU policies
                    recognise that every decision we make, we continue to make
                    on a shared platform. A strong shared GSU platform with more
                    voices will help us press for more resources and action. We
                    will also share and manage that success by engaging
                    effectively with others such as the academic staff whom we
                    can respect and love and work with. 
                    </br></br>I want the GSU to be a
                    key voice in the big picture and long-term thinking around
                    the future of higher education in Ireland. Postgraduates
                    make an impact, and I am proud of everything that we have
                    achieved and will achieve. I will honour you by bringing the
                    I CARE philosophy into education; to support thinkers and
                    researchers who will bring change to the world. 
                    </br></br>I care about
                    every part of our Trinity College community including the
                    academics, the professional staff, the workers of all kinds
                    and most of all the students. I want every single
                    postgraduate student to know that GSU cares about them and
                    about their Trinity experience. I’ll be bringing my
                    commitment online and offline, I’ll be bringing it into the
                    centre and I’ll be visiting the margins and connecting with
                    the research students in off campus sites like James and
                    Tallaght. I will work to be of maximum assistance to ALL
                    postgraduates with the Vice President Abhisweta
                    Bhattacharjee. We will create better ways of working so that
                    we can offer hope and support even in the context of
                    Covid-19. 
                    </br></br>My promise as President is this, I will continue
                    to care for each and every one of you, I wish all of you
                    well this week and say again “Thank You!”
